from copertv5 excel to webapp (eventually)
This program uses the COPERT 5 polinome to calculate emissions factors and energy consumption. It gets the parameter from the official COPERT 5 excel

TODO: 
- Calculate km/lt
- Calculate CO2/SOx
- Calculate BC from PM using another input (excel or csv)
- Output format
- Make it pretty
- WebApp
